# Model jalen:viam-roomba:base

A Viam base component for the iRobot Roomba 650/655 using the Roomba Open Interface (OI) serial protocol. Supports full movement control via `SetVelocity`, `SetPower`, `MoveStraight`, and `Spin`, with accurate movement detection by polling wheel velocity sensors.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "serial_port": "<string>",
  "width_mm": <int>,
  "wheel_circumference_mm": <int>
}
```

### Attributes

| Name                    | Type   | Inclusion | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `serial_port`           | string | Required  | Serial port path for the USB-to-TTL adapter (e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0`)          |
| `width_mm`              | int    | Optional  | Wheelbase width in mm. Defaults to `235` (Roomba 600 series)                |
| `wheel_circumference_mm`| int    | Optional  | Wheel circumference in mm. Defaults to `220` (Roomba 600 series)            |

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "serial_port": "/dev/ttyUSB0",
  "width_mm": 235,
  "wheel_circumference_mm": 220
}
```

## DoCommand

### `enter_full_mode`

Switches the Roomba to Full mode, disabling cliff sensor and other safety stops. Useful when the robot is on an elevated surface or in a test environment.

```json
{ "command": "enter_full_mode" }
```

### `enter_safe_mode`

Switches the Roomba back to Safe mode, re-enabling safety features.

```json
{ "command": "enter_safe_mode" }
```

### `enter_passive_mode`

Switches the Roomba to Passive mode. In Passive mode the OI listens for commands but does not accept movement or actuator commands. Use this to allow the Roomba to charge normally on the dock — the Roomba will only charge when the OI is in Passive mode.

```json
{ "command": "enter_passive_mode" }
```

### `seek_dock`

Sends the Roomba to its charging dock.

```json
{ "command": "seek_dock" }
```

### `clean`

Starts the Roomba's default cleaning routine.

```json
{ "command": "clean" }
```

### `stop`

Immediately stops all wheel movement.

```json
{ "command": "stop" }
```

### `move_straight`

Moves the Roomba straight a given distance at a given speed.

```json
{
  "command": "move_straight",
  "distance_mm": <number>,
  "mm_per_sec": <number>
}
```
